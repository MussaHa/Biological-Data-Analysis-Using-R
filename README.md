This data is collected from a research project entitled : Productivity of Shallot (Allium cepa Var. ascalonicum) as Influenced by nitrogen and harvesting time. It was conducted to determine the optimal nitrogen fertilizer level and harvesting time for local shallot variety. The experimental design was Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) containing two factors, such as : Four levels of Nitrogen fertilizer (0, 50,100,150kg/ha) and Three Harvesting time (25%,75% and 100% top fall).
